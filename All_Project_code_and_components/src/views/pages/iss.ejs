	<p> The International Space Station (ISS) is a habitable artificial satellite that orbits the Earth. It is a joint project between five space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia),  JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).</p>
	<p> The ISS is the largest human-made structure in space and is about the size of a football field. It travels around the Earth at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour and completes an orbit every 90 minutes. Astronauts on board the ISS conduct scientific experiments, perform maintenance tasks, and conduct spacewalks.</p>
	<p> The ISS has been continuously inhabited since November 2, 2000, and has been visited by astronauts from 19 countries. It is a symbol of international cooperation and a testament to human innovation and exploration.</p>
